----------------------Grepping with Git------------------------------------------------------

git grep -e "Tutorial"
first.txt:Tutorial
second.txt:git Tutorial


//---To have matches broken up with line numbers and grouped by file

git grep --line-number --heading --break -e "Tutorial"
first.txt
1:Tutorial

second.txt
2:git Tutorial


//---If I make a change in the working area, and use `git grep` again.
//Because `second.txt` is tracked, `git grep` will pick up the change.

(initial second.txt content)

git grep --line-number -e "Tutorial"
first.txt:1:Tutorial
second.txt:2:git Tutorial
second.txt:4:Fun Tutorial

//If I try `git grep --cached` - this will only search the version in the staging area, so the new change will be ignored.

git grep --line-number --cached -e "Tutorial"
first.txt:1:Tutorial
second.txt:2:git Tutorial
(there's no line 4)

//If I stage the file and try again.

git add second.txt
git grep --line-number --cached -e "Tutorial"
first.txt:1:Tutorial
second.txt:2:git Tutorial
second.txt:4:Fun Tutorial
(now there it is!)

//When there's changes in a specific commit in another branch that I'd like to bring into my current branch,
//without merging everything from the other branch.
